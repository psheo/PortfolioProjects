# PortfolioProjects

In this GitHub repository, I have shared the code for data cleaning and data exploration using SQL. The code can be used to clean and explore large datasets.

About the Project:

The project includes two main components:

Data Cleaning: This component involves removing any inconsistencies and errors in the dataset. 
The code includes several SQL queries to identify and correct the errors. The cleaning process ensures that the data is accurate and reliable.

Data Exploration: This component involves analyzing the data to gain insights and knowledge. 
The code includes several SQL queries to explore the dataset and identify patterns and trends.

How to Use:

To use the code, you will need a database management system, such as MySQL or SQL Server. 
The dataset should also be uploaded to the database. Once you have set up the database 
and uploaded the data, you can run the SQL queries to clean and explore the data.
